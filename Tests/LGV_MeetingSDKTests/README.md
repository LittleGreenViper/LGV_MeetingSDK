# ``LGV_MeetingSDKTests``

## Overview

These tests are pretty much worthless.

They were a set of shims that I created, as I was developing the SDK.

They will test the basic parser, but only in a predictable way, so they aren't really indicative of any real world implementation.

Instead, use the test harness, and concrete implementations for testing.

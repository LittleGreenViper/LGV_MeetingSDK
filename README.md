# ``LGV_MeetingSDK``

An adaptible SDK, for finding and listing regularly-occurring, scheduled events.

## Overview

This SDK provides a (mostly) protocol-based definition of an SDK that can be applied to low-level server connections, when the server provides information on regularly-scheduled (weekly) events.

The information is "commoditized" into a relatively straightforward structure, so different types of servers, with different behaviors, can be abstracted behind a common fa√ßade.
